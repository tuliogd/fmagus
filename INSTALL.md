## Use this package as a dev library

Depend on it.

Run this command in your project's root directory:

```
flutter pub add -d fmagus
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```
dev_dependencies:
  fmagus: ^0.1.0
```

Run this command if necessary:

```
flutter pub get
```

You are ready to use the package.
